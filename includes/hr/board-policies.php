					<h2>CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>

					<div style="padding:10px;">
						<h4>1. Objective</h4>
						Matrix Sourcing strives to maintain a work & learning environment for its staff in which honesty, integrity and respect for fellow employees and the customers/clients of the office are constantly reflected in the employees’ behavior, attitude and actions. The purpose of this document is to provide a clear framework within which employees are expected to conduct themselves. All staff also bear a responsibility as employees to act as ambassadors for the company in terms of their general conduct both within and outside the organization.<br />
						<br />
						This code covers some of the most important issues relating to personal conduct, and gives a framework of standards and behavioral guidelines, but it is not intended to be exhaustive.<br />
						<br />
						<br />

						<h4>2. Trust and Credibility</h4>
						The success of our business is dependent on the trust and confidence we earn from our employees, customers and shareholders. We gain credibility by adhering to our commitments, displaying honesty and integrity and reaching company goals solely through honorable conduct.<br />
						<br />
						<br />

						<h4>3. Equal Opportunities</h4>
						Matrix Sourcing seeks to ensure that the work environment for its employees is supportive and one where individual respect is shown to all. All members of staff, regardless of their gender, race, ethnic background, culture, (dis)ability, sexual orientation, age, religion, socio-economic status or any other factor will be treated equally, and will be supported and encouraged to perform to their potential.<br />
						<br />
						<br />

						<h4>4. A Culture of Open and Honest Communication</h4>
						At Matrix Sourcing everyone should feel comfortable to speak his or her mind, particularly with respect to ethical concerns. Managers have a responsibility to create an open and supportive environment where employees feel comfortable raising such questions. We all benefit tremendously when employees exercise their power to prevent mistakes or wrongdoing by asking the right questions at the right times.<br />
						<br />
						Matrix Sourcing will investigate all reported instances of questionable or unethical behavior. In every instance where improper behavior is found to have occurred, the company will take appropriate action.

						<br />
						<br />

						<h4>5. Grievance Policy</h4>
						Matrix Sourcing is committed to ensuring that everyone is able to work without fear of harassment, bullying or intimidation.

Any other grievances, such as those relating to resources allocation and requirements, and any other unfair treatment should also be referred to the supervisor or directly to human resources.<br />

In cases of doubt, advice and counsel should be sought from the next level of administrator.<br />
						<br />
						All interactions with the opposite gender must take into account the norms of our culture, society and those of a corporate work environment. A personal, non work-related relationship with team members of the opposite gender is discouraged due to the complications it may present for the organization.
